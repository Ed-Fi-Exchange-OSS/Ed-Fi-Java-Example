     * Retrieves specific resources using the resource&#39;s property values (using the \&quot;Get\&quot; pattern). (asynchronously)
     * This GET operation provides access to resources using the \&quot;Get\&quot; search pattern.  The values of any properties of the resource that are specified will be used to return all matching results (if it exists).
     * @param offset Indicates how many items should be skipped before returning results. (optional, default to 0)
     * @param limit Indicates the maximum number of items that should be returned in the results. (optional, default to 25)
     * @param minChangeVersion Used in synchronization to set sequence minimum ChangeVersion (optional)
     * @param maxChangeVersion Used in synchronization to set sequence maximum ChangeVersion (optional)
     * @param totalCount Indicates if the total number of items available should be returned in the &#39;Total-Count&#39; header of the response.  If set to false, &#39;Total-Count&#39; header will not be provided. (optional, default to false)
     * @param beginDate The earliest date the student is involved with the program. Typically, this is the date the student becomes eligible for the program. (optional)
     * @param educationOrganizationId The identifier assigned to an education organization. (optional)
     * @param programEducationOrganizationId The identifier assigned to an education organization. (optional)
     * @param programName The formal name of the Program of instruction, training, services, or benefits available through federal, state, or local agencies. (optional)
     * @param programTypeDescriptor The type of program. (optional)
     * @param studentUniqueId A unique alphanumeric code assigned to a student. (optional)
     * @param continuationOfServicesReasonDescriptor The \&quot;continuation of services\&quot; provision found in Section 1304(e) of the statute provides that (1) a child who ceases to be a migratory child during a school term shall be eligible for services until the end of such term; (2) a child who is no longer a migratory child may continue to receive services for one additional school year, but only if comparable services are not available through other programs; and (3) secondary school students who were eligible for services in secondary school may continue to be served through credit accrual programs until graduation. Only students who received services at any time during their 36 month eligibility period may continue to receive services (not necessarily the same service). (optional)
     * @param eligibilityExpirationDate The Eligibility Expiration Date is used to determine end of eligibility and to account for a child&#39;s eligibility expiring earlier than 36 months from the child&#39;s QAD. A child&#39;s eligibility would end earlier than 36 months from the child&#39;s QAD, if the child is no longer entitled to a free public education (e.g., graduated with a high school diploma, obtained a high school equivalency diploma (HSED), or for other reasons as determined by States&#39; requirements), or if the child passes away. (optional)
     * @param lastQualifyingMove Date the last qualifying move occurred; used to compute MEP status. (optional)
     * @param priorityForServices Report migratory children who are classified as having \&quot;priority for services\&quot; because they are failing, or most at risk of failing to meet the State&#39;s challenging State academic content standards and challenging State student academic achievement standards, and their education has been interrupted during the regular school year. (optional)
     * @param qualifyingArrivalDate The Qualifying Arrival Date (QAD) is the date the child joins the worker who has already moved, or the date when the worker joins the child who has already moved. The QAD is the date that the child&#39;s eligibility for the MEP begins. The QAD is not affected by subsequent non-qualifying moves. (optional)
     * @param stateResidencyDate The verified State residency for the student. (optional)
     * @param usInitialEntry The month, day, and year on which the Student first entered the U.S. (optional)

     * @param usMostRecentEntry The month, day, and year of the Student&#39;s most recent entry into the U.S. (optional)
     * @param snapshotIdentifier Indicates the Snapshot-Identifier that should be used. (optional)
     * @param _callback The callback to be executed when the API call finishes
